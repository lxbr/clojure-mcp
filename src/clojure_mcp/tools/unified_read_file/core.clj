   - limit: Maximum number of lines to read (default 2000)

   Returns a map with:

   - :path - The absolute path to the file
   - :truncated? - Whether the file was truncated due to line limit
   - :truncated-by - The reason for truncation (e.g., 'max-lines')

   - :line-count - The number of lines returned
   - :offset - The line offset used
